# CODEOWNERS file for API Test Automation project
#
# This file defines code ownership for different parts of the codebase.
# When someone opens a pull request that modifies code with an owner,
# those owners will automatically be requested for review.
#
# For more information about the CODEOWNERS file, see:
# https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# they will be requested for review when someone opens a pull request.
